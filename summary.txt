# Resume / Personal Summary Guidelines

The resume file should be a narrative text that presents a professional profile in a readable, natural way. Unlike a formal CV, it allows more freedom of expression and storytelling, while still highlighting skills, experience, and interests. The goal is to give readers (recruiters, collaborators, or clients) a sense of the person's expertise, motivations, and personality.

## How to Structure It

1. **Profile / Introduction**  
   - Start with a few sentences introducing the professional background, interests, and career focus.  
   - Include key strengths or areas of expertise in a conversational tone.  
   - Mention motivation, adaptability, or approach to learning and problem-solving.  

2. **Education**  
   - Describe relevant academic background, degrees, or specialized training.  
   - Highlight the focus areas, projects, or achievements without listing formal dates unless necessary.  

3. **Experience / Projects**  
   - Write in a narrative style about professional experience, internships, or personal projects.  
   - Include what was done, the tools or technologies used, and the impact or learning outcomes.  
   - Focus on storytelling: explain the challenges, solutions, and results.  

4. **Certifications / Training**  
   - Mention important courses, certifications, or workshops.  
   - Can describe them briefly and explain why they were pursued or what skills were gained.  

5. **Skills and Strengths**  
   - Include technical and soft skills.  
   - Present them as part of the narrative rather than a list — e.g., “Proficient in Python and machine learning frameworks, enjoys applying analytical reasoning to solve complex problems.”  

6. **Languages**  
   - Mention languages spoken and levels of proficiency naturally in the text.  

7. **Interests / Extracurricular Activities**  
   - Include hobbies, sports, volunteering, or activities that show personality, discipline, or teamwork.  
   - Explain how these activities complement professional or academic growth.  

## Style Tips

- Write in the first person or neutral voice (generic version: avoid personal pronouns like "I" if desired).  
- Keep paragraphs concise, clear, and flowing logically.  
- Mix technical details with narrative description to make it engaging.  
- Avoid overly formal or rigid CV formatting; the focus is on readability and storytelling.  
- The file should be saved as plain text (`.md`) for GitHub or documentation purposes.
