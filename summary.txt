I am Reda, a motivated engineering student in Morocco, currently in the 2nd year of the engineering cycle at EMINES – School of Industrial Management (UM6P), after two years of CPGE MP*. I am highly interested in AI, machine learning and agentic systems, with Udemy certifications in Machine Learning A-Z, AI Engineer Agentic Track, and Artificial Intelligence A-Z, as well as Coursera training in sequential models. I have built a decoder-only transformer (GPT-style) and I am currently following agentic AI coursework. I enjoy learning, adapting, and working in teams, especially on technical and applied projects.

At EMINES, I have developed an employee management system for OCP, simulated the respiratory cycle in a pulmonary acinus, designed and analyzed a spaghetti geodesic dome using mechanics of continuous media, created a VBA-Power BI solution to automate OCP quality reporting, and contributed to a strategic internationalization plan for a Moroccan AI startup. My technical skills include Python, Java, MySQL, machine learning models, agentic AI, Microsoft Office, Power BI, MS Project and WBS. I have completed internships in geological observation in Asni and industrial desalination of sea water and laboratory analysis at OCP.

I speak Arabic (native), English (bilingual), and French (intermediate). Outside academics, I stay active through swimming, football, and I hold a black belt in Taekwondo. I also enjoy chess and subjects that require precise, mathematical and technical reasoning, and I am curious about how real systems work, from engineering and industrial scheduling to economics, and information dynamics.
